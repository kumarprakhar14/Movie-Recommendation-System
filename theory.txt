There are broadly three types of recomendation system:
i. Content based recomendation system
ii. Colleborative filtering recomendation system
iii. Hybrid recomendation system

1. Content based recomendation system:
    It works by recommending the things based on the content. 
    For eg. if a person likes romantic song, the system will recommend other romantic songs to him.

2. Colleborative filtering recomendation system:
    It works by taking similarity between a no. of users and if one of them likes a content the system 
    will recommend the same content to other person as well.
    For eg. if two person have a similarity score of 0.9 and both of them watch a movie named M1, and then one 
    person watches another movie named M2, then system will recommend the same movie to other person as well.

3. Hybrid recomendation system: 
    It includes the features of both of the above systems
